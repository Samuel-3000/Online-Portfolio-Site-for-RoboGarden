        <p>Hello, my name is Sam.</p>
        <div>
            <p> I was born on mm/dd/yyyy (Date of birth left out due to this is a public github repository). My education consists of a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from Western University. In terms of web projects, my experience is limited. I currently work as a Registered Nurse. I am fluent only in the English language. My favourite activities include playing video games on PS4 Pro and PC.
